Hello, welcome to my personal tech blog to chronical my coding and tech-related topics. Over the years, I've read many blogs and forums for answers to my millions of questions. So now, I hope to give back and contribute my share to future developers and innovators.

I'm currently an electronics and instrumentation engineer working for the R&D division of an aerospace company. My passion for working in engineering stems from many years in academics working on bleeding edge biomedical and robotics projects. However, my true passion is in drone development and AI.
Anything I write here does not reflect the opinion of my employer in any way.

By day - I'm an engineer, loving what I do, and just building and coding radical cool shit. By evening, I switch gears and give my full attention to my two girls until they're tucked in...
And for those few short remaining hours between 10pm - 2am, I dive deep into my personal skunk-like projects that will hopefully benefit my daughters, family and friends. 

I hope you enjoy this site.
